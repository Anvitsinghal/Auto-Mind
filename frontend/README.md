# Autonomous Predictive Vehicle Health & Maintenance System  
*(EY Techathon 6.0 – Challenge III: Automotive | Hero + Mahindra & Mahindra)*

## Overview
This project presents an **AI-driven autonomous vehicle health and predictive maintenance platform** designed to proactively monitor vehicle components, simulate real-world trips, and prevent unexpected failures.

The system continuously evaluates sensor data, usage patterns, and component health to **predict failures before they occur**, optimize service scheduling, and provide intuitive visual insights for drivers, OEMs, and fleet operators.

Built with a **real-time vehicle simulation and digital twin mindset**, the platform demonstrates how AI can reduce breakdowns, improve safety, and lower maintenance costs in next-generation automotive systems.

## Key Capabilities
- 🔧 **Predictive Maintenance Engine**  
  Detects early signs of component degradation (battery, brakes, tires, engine health).

- 🚗 **Trip Simulation & Failure Prediction**  
  Simulates long-distance trips (e.g., 560 km) and predicts whether the vehicle can safely complete the journey.

- 📊 **Vehicle Health Dashboard**  
  Visualizes real-time health scores of all major vehicle subsystems.

- 🧠 **AI-Based Risk Scoring**  
  Generates risk levels (Low / Medium / High) for each component using historical and live signals.

- 🛠️ **Smart Service Recommendations**  
  Suggests preventive service actions before critical failures occur.

- 🧩 **OEM & Fleet Insights (Optional Layer)**  
  Aggregated insights for manufacturers and fleet operators to identify recurring issues and improve reliability.
